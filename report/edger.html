<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> EdgeR</h2>
<p>In brief, all read count data is modelled using an overdispersed Poisson model. Gene dispersions are then estimated by conditional maximum likelihood and shrunk using an empirical Bayes procedure. Finally, differential expression is assessed using an adapted Fisher’s exact test. EdgeR analysis has been implemented as previously published in <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.5.1</span> P Value Distribution</h3>
<p>The p value distribution for random data is a flat distribution. If this analysis method performed well it should assign low p values to data points which is do not seem to be randomly distributed. So, if there are differential genes present there should be a peak in the histogram towards 0. The rest of the histogram should still be more or less flat. If the histogram shows other shapes the analysis method might not have worked well.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.5.3</span> P Value vs LFC</h3>
<p>This scatter plot shows adjusted p values in combination with their fold-changes of normalized readcounts. The p value does not directly relate to the fold-change. Some genes might show a huge fold-change but still have a low p value and vice versa. These analysis methods usually “downgrade” the significance if the fold-change is to high or to low. However, a gene with low p value and low fold-change might be significant but not biologically interesting.</p>
