# CRISPRAnalyzeR - Fully-interactive Analysis and Documentation of Pooled CRISPR Screens
Welcome to the CRISPRAnalyzeR Github page!

CRISPRAnalyeR is a web-based, fully interactive suite for the analysis and documentation of pooled CRISPR Screens.

#### See the live-demo of [CRISPRAnalyzeR](http://crispr-analyzer.dkfz.de)

CRISPRAnalyzeR has been specifically developed to provide a fully-interactive, hollistic and exploratory analysis of pooled CRISPR Screens especially for those people that perform the screens themselves.
You can easily analyse your screen using 6 different hit calling methods, 2 essential gene calling methods as well as perform gene annotation anrichment and gene set analysis - all in a convenient web-browser interface.

## What makes CRISPRAnalyzeR the perfect tool to analyze pooled CRISPR Screens?

CRISPRAnalyzeR uses what we call a **guided-analysis** approach. This means you will be **guided through the whole analysis, focusing on the most important things - your data**.

### The principle CRISPRANalyzeR Analysis Workflow
![The principle Workflow](https://github.com/boutroslab/crispr-analyzer/blob/master/images/workflow3.png)

CRISPAnalyzeR consists of **four sections**:
- Screen Quality Estimation
- Hit Calling using multiple published hit calling methods
- Hit Confirmation with extensive Gene information, sgRNA information, Gene Set Analysis and much more
- Download of the interactive report that provides a comprehensive documentation of your screen

**Analysing CRISPR Screens has never been easier - and has never been so much fun!**
