checkseqfilesprogress1	Checking Uploaded Sequencing Files
checkseqfiles1	You will compare 2 conditions, so we expect at least 2 sequencing files.<br/>
checkseqfiles2	There is an empty file name.<br/>
checkseqfiles3	Please use unique files.<br/>
checkseqfiles4	Please only use characters, numbers, or "_" in your files names as those are used for data processing.<br/>
checkseqfiles5	Please only upload compressed FASTQ files. Compression is usually done using the gzip command. <br/> By default, your sequencing company should provide you with already compressed files (*.fastq.gz).<br/>
checkseqfiles6	There is an empty file name.<br/>
checkseqfiles7	Please use unique file names.<br/>
checkseqfiles8	Please only use numbers, characters, or "_" in your file names.<br/>
checkseqfiles9	Honestly, I don't even know how this happened, but 2 datapaths are the same.<br/>
checkseqfilesprogress2	Filenames checked
checkseqfilesprogress3	Check FASTQ files
checkseqfilesprogress4	Check FASTQ regular expression
checkseqfiles10	The entered FASTQ regular expression did only work for   
checkseqfiles11	% of sequences within your FASTQ files.<br/>This is an indication for a wrong FASTQ Regular Expression or a bad quality of your sequencing library.
checkseqfilesprogress5	Checking Readcount Data
checkseqfiles12	Please make sure your Readcount file <strong>
checkseqfiles13	</strong> is properly formatted.<br/>Your sgRNA identifier must be separated by a tabular from the read count for this sgRNA.<br/>In this case it seems you have not only digits where we expect read counts (excluding the header).<br/>Please see the help for more information.<br/><br/>
checkseqfiles14	</strong> is properly formatted.<br/>Your sgRNA identifier must be separated by a tabular from the read count for this sgRNA.<br/>In this case, it seems you have more than two columns that are separated by a tabular.<br/>Please see the help for more information.<br/>
checklibfileprogress1	Checking sgRNA Library File
checklibfileprogress2	checking filenames
checklibfileprogress3	Check Regular Expressions
checklibfile1	There is an empty file name.<br/>
checklibfile2	Don't use special characters like *, # or % in your file name<br/>
checklibfile3	Please upload a fasta file (*.fasta).<br/>
checklibfile4	Provide a regular expression for gene extraction.<br/>
checklibfile5	The provided regex
checklibfile6	does not contain two capturing groups () to catch the gene as well as the sgRNA identifier part.<br/>Please see the little help symbol next to the select file button.<br/>
checklibfile7	The provided regex
checklibfile8	doesn't work with this file.<br/>
checklibfile9	You have empty lines in your sgRNA library FASTA file.<br/>
checklibfile10	The sgRNA identifiers in the provided sgRNA library file are not unique.<br/> Please make sure only unique identifiers are used.<br/>
checklibfile11	The regular expression revealed a problem with your sgRNA identifier.<br/>Either the selected regular expression is not correct or you have missing/incorrect entries in your sgRNA library file.<br/>Please make sure every sgRNA identifier consists of a gene identifier and a unique sgRNA identifier part.<br/>
checklibfile12	The regular expression revealed a problem with your sgRNA identifier.<br/>Either the selected regular expression is not correct or you have missing/incorrect entries in your sgRNA library file.<br/>
checklibfile13	The regular expression revealed a problem with your gene identifier as part of your sgRNA identifier.<br/>Either the selected regular expression is not correct or you have missing/incorrect entries in your sgRNA library file.<br/>
checklibfile14	The regular expression revealed a problem with your gene/sgRNA identifier as part of your sgRNA identifier.<br/>Either the selected regular expression cannot discriminate between the gene and sgRNA part of your identifier<br/> or you have missing/incorrect entries in your sgRNA library file.<br/> As an example, this was found to be the case for sgRNA
checklibfile15	The sgRNA identifier within your library FASTA file are not unique.
checkgroupnames1	For a comparison at least 2 groups are needed.<br/>
checkgroupnames2	Each group should have a unique name.<br/>
checkgroupnames3	There is a group without a name.<br/>
checkgroupnames4	Please don't use weird characters like *, # or % in your group name<br/>
checkgroupnames5	Please use no spaces in your group names. Use '_' instead<br/>
checkgroups1	Some groups don't have any files associated with them.<br/>
checkgroups3	Some files belong two more than one group.
checkgroups2	Some groups don't have any files associated with them.<br/>
checkextract	Provide a regular expression for target sequence extraction.<br/>
checkextractedfiles	For further assistence please briefly describe your problem on the CRISPRAnalyzeR Github page in the issue section @ http://github.com/boutroslab/CRISPRAnalyzeR.<br>
checkcompare1	Positive control
checkcompare2	was not found in sgRNA library.
checkcompare3	Non-targeting control
checkanalysissettings1	There are some P values < 0 or > 1. That doesn't really make sense.<br/>
checkanalysissettings2	Please enter a sgRNA read count Threshold.<br/>
checkanalysissettings3	Please use positive numbers only.<br/>
checkanalysissettings4	Please use numbers for sgRNA read count thresholds only.<br/>
noanalysisrunyet	CRISPRAnalyzeR has not performed an analysis yet.
bagelerror	BAGEL analysis could not be performed.
screenbeamerror	ScreenBEAM analysis was not performed.
getinfo1	Please wait until CRISPRAnalyzeR has sucessfully re-annotated your sgRNAs<br>to provide you even more useful information.<br/><br/>This can take up to 10-30 minutes<br>depending on your library size and CRISPRAnalyzeR usage.<br/>In the meantime you can have a closer look to the Quality Control and Hit Calling sections.
getinfo2	Please wait until your sgRNAs have been reannotated.
biomart1	Data could not be retrieved from Ensembl BiomaRt. Please try again later or check the proxy configuration.
